Based on the hardware circuit design and related software programming of the DC motor speed control system, this DC motor uses a 51 single-chip microcomputer as the data processing chip and has various additional circuits to ensure the normal operation of the circuit. It has three control keys and one reset key, and can independently adjust the duty cycle of the PWM to control the motor speed. Users can control the duty cycle of the PWM (20%, 50%, 80%) by pressing the relevant gear keys. They can freely select the speed of the DC motor according to the keys and also control it via the Bluetooth system on their mobile phones.
